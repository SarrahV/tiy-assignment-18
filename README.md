# Passing tests with Mocha and Chai

Create a new project with Mocha and Chai. Include the test.extending.js test suite and make it passing.  

There are 3 parts to the test you will need to solve  

You will need to create a hierarchy of several constructors for different types of vehicles all  
descending from a root vehicle.

You will have to create a base hash (object) called extendee with various keys and values.   
You will then need to create another object called extended and use _.extend to make it extend the extendee object.

Finally you will need to create a function called param the function should accept some parameters 
and return them. The function should have a set of default parameters that can be overridden.
